Implementation of Neural Net with Configurable Error Tolerance, partition into Training and Testing Data, #Hidden Layers and #Neurons in each Hidden Layer.

For Compiling : 
javac NueralNet.java

For running :
java NueralNet [complete path of the post-processed input dataset] [training percent] [error tolerance] [no. of hidden layers] [number of neurons in each layer]

	
There is no limit on to the maximum number of hidden layers allowed but lesser the number of hidden layers, quicker the result we will get.
